# EVELO

## Company blurb

EVELO is a Seattle based company that helps people live a more healthy and active lifestyle. Our electric bikes are thoughtfully designed and masterfully built. We strive to offer them at a great price, deliver them directly to your door, and offer pre- and post-sale customer service that you can trust for years to come.
People have been happily choosing EVOLO because of the following six major reasons:-
1. Industry-Leading Warranty
EVELO electric bikes and trikes are manufactured to the highest quality standards and are backed by our industry-leading 4-year/20,000-mile Warranty. This is double what most other manufacturers are able to offer. Higher quality products are more expensive to manufacture but help us keep our warranty expenses down in the long run.
2. No-Risk Decision
For most people an electric bike is a significant investment. We have a Free 21-day, At-Home Trial for all new bike purchases. The clock doesn’t start until your bike is delivered, so have confidence in your purchase. If your EVELO is not the right fit for whatever reason, we’ll pay for return shipping and send you a replacement bike -or- issue a full refund. No restocking fees, return shipping, or charges of any kind.
3. Impeccable Reputation
Hundreds of raving reviews, from people just like you, don’t lie. We have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, a 4.9/5 rating on Shopper Approved and 4.6/5 on Facebook, with hundreds of Customer Reviews.
4. Built with Premium Components & Made to Last
ll electric bicycles are not built the same. With hand selected parts built to last decades, we use the best components available when designing our bicycles - specifically with our customers in mind. Mid Drive Motor technology, the Gates Belt Drive, and Enviolo CVT Drivetrain components can be found on many of our models, and is how we arrive at a quality, easy to use, and reliable electric bicycle.
5. Unparalleled Support
Our U.S.-based team of friendly electric bike experts are available 7 days a week. We will help you pick the perfect electric bike that’s comfortable and easy to ride. After you make a purchase, we provide comprehensive support over email or over the phone for years to come, even after your warranty expires. We also handle all service logistics when we need a local bike shop as well, so sit back and relax - we've got you covered.
6. We have a Direct Relationship with You
EVELO has been built from the ground up as a Direct To Consumer (DTC) brand, meaning we are the top of the food chain when it comes to the design and manufacturing of our products. While we're happy to work with local shops for assembly and service, you won't find EVELO in your local store. This is intentional, as it offers our customers significant benefits and value vs. paying traditional retail pricing.
